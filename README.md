# ItemCodes-Generator

This executable runs a program to convert a .csv file into a .h file for use with the warehouse printer. 

It requires a .csv file, not a .xlsx file. Simeply save the .xlsx file to .csv and use that. The output of the program is located in the same directory as the .exe file. Move this file into the printer firmware file and re-upload to the printer to use the new item list codes.
